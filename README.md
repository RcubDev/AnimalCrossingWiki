# Animal Crossing Wiki

## Project description
Made in 2020 after Animal Crossing New Horizons was released to learn react and react native. Intended to be a place to keep track of what items, fish, fossils, bugs, art you have collected in the game. Currently is unfinished but a lot of functionality was added while it was being worked on.

### Technologies
- Created using react native and Expo
- Tested on iOS 8


## Features
- Caught and donated fish tracking & info 
- Fish filtering based on size, location, season, and more
- Caught and donated bug tracking & info
- Bug filtering based on price, size, location, season, and more
- Donated fossil tracking
- Donated art work tracking
- Music collection tracking
- Reaction tracking
- Villagers
- Furniture catalog tracking and info
- Clothing catalog tracking and info
- There are also remnants of a lexer/language parser that was meant to make it so you could query items easily. It worked for a bit but was later broken. Uses redux to store state.

### Info examples (updated UI)
These are too large to fit into a readme. Please view them on youtube:
- [Example 1](https://youtu.be/DpiDQ-AtUxQ).
- [Example 2](https://youtu.be/CVWNzDfDYvI). Note the left checkmark on fish and bugs mean caught and the right checkmarks mean they were donated to the museum. These were intended to be changed to recognizable icons from the game but never made it into the repository

### Other notes
- The beginning of the project a web crawler was written to parse data from the animal crossing wiki pages. Later on an api was found that was usable and required a significant amount of less work so it was swapped to that. Note that the API is not something that was written for this so if it goes down the application might not work.
